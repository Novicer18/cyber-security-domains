            <p>
                Cryptography is the science and practice of securing information by transforming it into an unreadable format, 
                known as ciphertext, which can only be reverted to its original form, plaintext, by authorized parties possessing 
                the correct decryption key. This domain encompasses a variety of techniques and algorithms designed to ensure 
                confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data. Common cryptographic methods include symmetric 
                encryption (where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption), asymmetric encryption (which uses a pair 
                of public and private keys), hashing (which generates a fixed-size output from variable-size input data), and digital 
                signatures (which verify the authenticity of digital messages or documents). Cryptography is widely used in various 
                applications such as secure communications (e.g., SSL/TLS for web browsing), data protection (e.g., disk encryption), 
                authentication protocols (e.g., digital certificates), and blockchain technologies. As cyber threats evolve, cryptography 
                continues to play a crucial role in safeguarding sensitive information against unauthorized access and cyberattacks.
